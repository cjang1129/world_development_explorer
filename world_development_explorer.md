## What is it that you are investigating/exploring/analyzing (provide sufficient background information)?
### My project will focus on the Financial sector for the years 2010-2019. Mainly on the number of stocks traded, the percent change of the S&P Global Equity Indices, and the percent of inflation in consumer prices. 

## Why is it important to you and/or to others?
### Numerous factors affect the financial sector and the stock market. I will be comparing the annual percentage of inflation (consumer prices) for both the United States (North America) and South Korea (East Asia & Pacific). These factors include presidential regimes, the global pandemic, and regional crises (i.e. housing crash of '08). 

## What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer?
### Does the volume of stocks being traded or the stability of the S&P Global Equity Indices give any prediction on the level of inflation?
### Can deflation or inflation be predicting factors on the stock market?
### Does inflation/deflation and the stock market have a correlation of the suicide rate?

## Where do you get the data to help answer your questions?
### All data and information would be coming from the World Development Indicators (WDI - http://www.worlddev.xyz/) 
### The WDI is a cross-country analytical tool that provides data on 1400+ socioeconomic indicators of 200+ countries over the span of 50+ years. It's primary datasource is the World Bank.
### The World Development Explorer (WDX) allows users to interact with the WDI on a click & play type of interface. The unique feature of the WDX is the incorporation of Hofestede's Cultural Dimensions which allows users to view how culture affects socioeconomic factors. 

## What process/step you use to analyze the situation/issue
### For this part of the project, I will be utilizing the various graphs from the world development website (www.worlddev.xyz)
